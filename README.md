# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot Analysis

This project analyzes and models mental health–related conversations to identify emotional themes, sentiment transitions, and topic clusters. It leverages **transformers**, **BERTopic**, and **unsupervised learning** to explore the linguistic and emotional structure of chat data related to mental health and well-being.

## 🚀 Features
- **Emotion & Sentiment Detection** using pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face.
- **Topic Modeling** with `BERTopic` and `HDBSCAN` to uncover recurring themes.
- **Conversation Analysis** to measure emotional transitions, coping themes, and sensitive content.
- **Data Visualization & Insights** for emotional progression across dialogues.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for emotion and sentiment classification
- **BERTopic** + **HDBSCAN** for unsupervised topic discovery
- **scikit-learn** for vectorization
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **tqdm** for progress tracking
- **Datasets** (Hugging Face) for loading and managing data

   ```

## 🧪 Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode:
```bash
jupyter notebook Mental_Health_Chatbot.ipynb
```

Follow the workflow:
1. Load the dataset (e.g., chat transcripts or text logs).
2. Run emotion/sentiment classification.
3. Apply topic modeling with BERTopic.
4. Export and visualize clustered insights.

## 📊 Example Outputs
- Emotion transition trends across conversations
- Thematic clusters such as *Stress & Overwhelm*, *Coping & Resilience*, *Grief & Loss*
- Sentiment progression and topic-level emotional intensity
